                    <div>To request an item, you must first identify yourself to the library's ILLiad system. To do this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.</div>
                    <div>Registration has three purposes:</div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Entering your personal information into the ILLiad system means you will not have to supply the information again when making future requests.</li>
                        <li>Having your email and regular mail addresses on file with ILLiad enables us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately.</li>
                        <li>By specifying a Username and Password of your choosing, you will have secure access to information about your requests. You will also be able to review the list of items you have requested in the past.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="info-block">
                    <h2 class="page-header">About your Username and Password</h2>
                    <div>During registration, you will be asked to choose a Username and Password. You will use this Username and Password when logging on to the ILLiad system in the future.</div>
                    <div><strong>Username</strong></div>
                    <div>Choose anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an alphanumeric code.</div>

                    <div><strong>Password</strong></div>
                    <div>Choose anything you like. We recommend that you follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use to access other systems.</div>
                    <div>ILLiad will encrypt your password, so it will remain secure. Only you will know your password.</div>

                    <div>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of articles or other reproductions of copyrighted materials.</div>
                    <div>Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish an article or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that 
                        the article or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research". If a user makes a request for, or later uses, an article 
                        or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use", that user may be liable for copyright infringement.
                    </div>
